# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This is repository about credit card fraud detection problem. Here you will find our implementation of 7 models and relative analysis.

You can find data at kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

**Algorithms**

1. Naive bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linear Discreminant Analysis
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest Classifier
6. Support Vector Machine
7. Deep Neural Network

Their Plain Implementation can be find our in [Credit card fraud detection notebook](https://github.com/kamlesh11/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Credit%20card%20fraud%20detection.ipynb).

In [Credit card fraud detection Undersampling](https://github.com/kamlesh11/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Credit%20card%20fraud%20detection%20Undersampling.ipynb) Notebook you can find implementation of undersampling and related analysis.

Similarly, In [Credit card fraud detection Oversampling](https://github.com/kamlesh11/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Credit%20card%20fraud%20detection%20Oversampling.ipynb) notebook you can find oversampling and related analysis.
